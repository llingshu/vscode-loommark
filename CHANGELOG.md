# Changelog

All notable changes to LoomMark are documented here. This project follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- GitHub community health files, continuous integration, release automation, citation metadata,
  and third-party notices.
- Collapsible in-editor outline and native Explorer TreeView with AST-based heading navigation.
- Source-preserving CodeMirror editing core with stale-update protection.
- Progressive heading, emphasis, link, wiki-link, inline-code, and fenced-code presentation.
- Wiki-link workspace completion and Ctrl/Cmd + click navigation.
- Language-aware code blocks with line numbers, copy controls, and an explicit language selector.
- Runtime editor diagnostics command for reproducible Webview bug reports.

### Changed

- Replaced the Milkdown/ProseMirror serialization pipeline with a continuous source-backed
  CodeMirror document. Opening a file no longer normalizes Markdown through a rich-text serializer.

### Added

- Source-backed Milkdown Crepe editor for Markdown files.
- Batched synchronization through minimal `WorkspaceEdit` replacements.

- Source-editor command in the custom editor title bar.
